# Reimbursement Project

Description: The objective of this project is to create a web portal in which users could enter their reimbursement requests classified by type of claim. 
On the administrative side of the portal, it will be possible to approve or reject the claims entered into the system. It will also contain a search system that will allow the administrator to search by the type of reimbursement that exists in the system.
